# Would You Rather? project

This is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
